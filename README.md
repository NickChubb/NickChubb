👋 Hi, I am a Computer Science & Molecular Biology student and aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

I have an avid interest in the field of software engineering, and currently I am working on furthering my own software skills by developing my own React web applications.  

Occasionally, when the mood strikes me, I also enjoy writing posts on my blog.
