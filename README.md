👋 Hi, I am a Computer Science & Molecular Biology student and aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

I have an avid interest in the field of software engineering, and currently I am working on furthering my own software skills by developing my own React web applications.  I find the field of biotech extremely interesting and I am particularly drawn to the comparisons that can be drawn between cellular machinery and computer systems, and how they influence each other.

In my free time I enjoy reading, going to the gym, and occasionally, when the mood strikes me, I also enjoy writing posts on my blog.
