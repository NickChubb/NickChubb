👋 Hi, I am recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science & Molecular Biology and aspiring Full-Stack Developer. 

**I am currently seeking Front-end/Full-stack dev positions starting immediately, please don't hestitate to reach out if you have an opportunity where you think I would be a great fit!**

I have an avid interest in the field of software engineering, and currently I am working on furthering my own software skills by developing my own React web applications.  I find the field of biotech extremely interesting and I am particularly drawn to the comparisons that can be drawn between cellular machinery and computer systems, and how they influence each other.

In my free time I enjoy reading, going to the gym, and spending time with friends and family.
